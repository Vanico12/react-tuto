            <p>
              I am a young software engineer training at the Faculty of
              Engineering and Technology(FET) of the University of Buea. 
              Being on demand for experience, I apply to
              a new startup company which accepted me and gave me the chance to work on real
              business projects in order to gain experience. From July 2021 to
              today, I learned technologies such as react, Node.js,
              I am still learning and counting on the
              support of this startup to increase my knowlegde of
              not only being a graduate but a good engineer and also qualified.
              I can express myself in French and in English (average).
